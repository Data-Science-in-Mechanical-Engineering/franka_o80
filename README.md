# Welcome to `franka_o80`
Here you will find an [o80](https://github.com/intelligent-soft-robots/o80) `C++` and `Python` wrappers around [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka).

### Structure
Some files and directories you may need to know about:
 - `include` - include directory for `C++` programmers
 - `src` - directory containing `C++` sources
 - `example` - directory containing finished `franka_o80` projects in form of `C++` sources or `Python` files
 - `build` - `cmake` build directory
 - `build/franka_o80_cpp.so` - shared library for `C++` programmers (could be linked with `-lfranka_o80_cpp`)
 - `build/franka_o80.so` - shared library for `Python` programmers (could be imported with `import franka_o80`)
 - `build/franka_o80_test_*` - dummy libraries for testing purposes
 - `build/example/franka_o80_backend` - executable for starting backend
 - `build/example/franka_o80_control` - application for basic robot control
 - `build/example/franka_o80_selftest` - [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) testing of the library

### Usage
[o80](https://github.com/intelligent-soft-robots/o80) may be sometimes not intuitive, and `franka_o80` inherits it’s flaws.

The project consists of frontend and backend. Frontend (`o80::Frontend` class) is used by programmer in `C++` or `Python`. It is responsible for sending commands and receiving observations from backend.

Backend (`o80::Backend` and `o80::Standalone` classes) is written in `C++` and does not need to be changed. It is responsible for communication with the [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka) and needs to be started on the same machine in order to use frontends.

All variables in `franka_o80` are represented as actuators in terms of [o80](https://github.com/intelligent-soft-robots/o80), even control mode, reset, error, velocities, torques, etc., so they are set with `add_command` as all other actuators. When reading observations, all actuators are defined. But some actuators (like `joint_position` and `cartesial_position`) obviously contradict each other, which of them will be used to control the robot, is decided by mode.  Non-intelligent modes directly correspond to `Robot::control` overloaded functions in [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka). Intelligent modes are implemented with `Robot::control(std::function<Torques(RobotState)>)` function.
